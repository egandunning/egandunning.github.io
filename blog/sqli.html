    <h2>SQL Injection</h2>
    <p>
      Keeping data secure is very important. Any application that talks to a
      database needs protection against SQL injection, an attack method where
      an SQL query is entered into a form where text is expected. Luckily, this
      attack is easy to prevent. As a software engineer/programmer, it is your
      responsibility to keep your database secure against SQL injection (SQLi
      for short).
    </p>
    <h4>Example with JDBC</h4>
    <p>
      The JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) library allows Java applications to
      talk to databases. Here is a snippet for example:
    </p>
    <div class="code">
      <label>Java</label>
      <code>
        ...<br>
        String uname = //get username from user input<br>
        String sql = "SELECT * FROM Users WHERE username='"+uname+"'";<br>
			  Statement stmt = connection.createStatement();<br>
			
        ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery(sql);<br>
        ...
      </code>
    </div>
    
    <p>
      In the code above, we assume that the connection has been set up, and
      that <code>uname</code> is provided by the user. This works just fine if
      the user enters a real username.
    </p>
    <p>
      But what if the user enters: <code>'; DROP TABLE USERS;</code> for their
      username? Nothing good... let's try it out.
    </p>

    <h4>Follow along</h4>

    <p>
      For this exercise, we will use a lightweight database, SQLite.
