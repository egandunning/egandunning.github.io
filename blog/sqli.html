    <h2>SQL Injection</h2>
    <p>
      Keeping data secure is very important. Any application that talks to a
      database needs protection against SQL injection, an attack method where
      an SQL query is entered into a form where text is expected. Luckily, this
      attack is easy to prevent. As a software engineer/programmer, it is your
      responsibility to keep your database secure against SQL injection (SQLi
      for short).
    </p>
    <h4>Example with JDBC</h4>
    <p>
      The JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) library allows Java applications to
      talk to databases. Here is a snippet for example:
    </p>
    <div class="code">
      <label>Java</label>
      <code>
        ...<br>
        String uname = //get username from user input<br>
        String sql = "SELECT * FROM Users WHERE username='"+uname+"'";<br>
			  Statement stmt = connection.createStatement();<br>
			
        ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery(sql);<br>
        ...
      </code>
    </div>
    
    <p>
      In the code above, we assume that the connection has been set up, and
      that <code>uname</code> is provided by the user. This works just fine if
      the user enters a real username.
    </p>
    <p>
      But what if the user enters: <code>'; DROP TABLE USERS;</code> for their
      username? Nothing good... let's try it out.
    </p>

    <p>
      For this exercise, we will use a lightweight database, SQLite. Before
      downloading anything, check to see if SQLite is installed. SQLite is
      included with most Linux distributions, and is probably available through
      your distro's package manager. Type this into the terminal/command
      prompt to check if SQLite is installed:
    </p>
    <p>
      <code>sqlite3 --version</code>
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are a Windows user, download the command-line tools from the
      SQLite website:
      <a href="http://sqlite.org/download.html">http://sqlite.org/download.html</a>
      Next, you will need to extract the zip file containing
      the SQLite executable files. On my machine, I extracted this file to
      <code>C:\</code>, so I can find it easily. Now you need to tell
      Windows where to find to find the SQLite command line tools, so add
      the location of the extracted folder to your PATH. Now, you should be
      able to manipulate SQLite databases from your command prompt.
    </p>

    <h4>Create a simple table</h4>
    <p>
      Using SQLite, lets make a basic table with two columns. You can add
      more columns if you want, but I want to keep this example as simple as
      possible. Create a new directory called "sqli-demo", then add a database
      inside that directory.
    </p>
    <p>
      <code>mkdir sqli-demo</code><br>
      <code>sqlite3 sqli</code><br>This opens the SQLite command line interface
      and creates a new database called "sqli".
    </p>
    <p>
      <code>create table users(id int, name varchar(20));</code><br>Creates a
      table called "users" with two columns.
    </p>
    <p>
      <code>insert into users values(1234, "jim");</code><br>
      <code>insert into users values(4321, "sue");</code><br>Insert some dummy
      data into the users table.
    </p>
    <p>
      <code>.quit</code><br>
      Exit the SQLite command-line interface.
    </p>

    <h4>Interact with the database using Java</h4>
    <p>
      To demonstrate SQLi, we will need to write a program that takes user
      input and interacts with the database using that input. Many real-world
      programs that use a database would typically run on a web server and
      get user input over the internet, but let's keep it simple and just
      create a command-line application.
    </p>
    <p>
      To run queries against an SQLite database, we need a JDBC driver written
      specifically for SQLite. You can find the driver
      <a href="https://github.com/xerial/sqlite-jdbc">here</a>, look for the
      download link in the readme. Once you have the JDBC jar, copy the jar
      into the "sqli-demo" directory.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, create a new Java file inside "sqli-demo". I named my Java file
      "Insecure.java". Inside Insecure.java, write the following code:
    </p>
    <div class="code">
      <label>java</label>
      <code>
        
      </code>
    </div>

    <h3>Runnable Example:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Includes MyObject.java, Read.java, readme.txt, Write.java</li>
      <li><a href="../documents/serializeExampleCode.zip">Download now</a> (2KB)</li>
    </ul>
