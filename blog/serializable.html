    <h2>Serializable Java Classes</h2>
    <p>
      In this post, I will explain object
      serialization in Java. Don't know what that means? Great! Keep reading!
    </p>
    <h4>Simple data persistence</h4>
    <p>
      There are lots of situations where you want the data in your program to
      persist after the program ends. All of the objects and variables in
      your program are stored in memory while the program is running. When your
      program stops running, that memory is freed so that other programs can
      use it, and all of your objects are gone forever! So we need a way to
      write the objects to disk while we can still access them (during program
      execution).
    </p>
    <p>
      One option would be to use a database, such as MySQL or SQLite. Databases
      are great for storing information, but we would need to install the
      database software, create the tables (unless you're using MongoDB), and
      write queries to access the data. If you just need to store something
      simple, using a database can be overkill, and it would be more trouble
      than it's worth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another option would be to override the <code>toString</code> method,
      so that you can write a string representation of the object to a text
      file. This makes saving the file really easy!
    </p>
    <p>
      But reading in the file and creating an object with its contents isn't
      as simple. One solution would be to read the text file line by line
      with a <code>Scanner</code>, then call the constructor with the data you
      find. But now, every time you add fields to your class, you will need to
      update the code that reads data from the text file.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is a better way - implement the <code>Serializable</code> interface
      in the class of the object you want to store. <code>Serializable</code>
      is a marker interface, meaning that it has no methods. Its purpose is to
      "mark" the class as something that can be serialized. To "serialize"
      means to represent the object as a stream of bytes. So, now we can
      serialize the object, then write those bytes to a file. When we need to
      access the object again, we just need to read in the file, then
      de-serialize the object.
    </p>
    <p>
      Java provides the <code>ObjectOutputStream</code> and
      <code>ObjectInputStream</code> classes to serialize and de-serialize
      objects. These classes have a <code>writeObject</code> and a
      <code>readObject</code> method, respectively.
    </p>
    <p>
      To write an object to a file called <code>object.obj</code> (the file
      extension can be anything you want), use the following pattern:
    </p>

    <div class="code">
      <label>Java</label>
      <pre>
        import java.io.ObjectOutputStream;
        import java.io.FileOutputStream;
        import java.io.File;

        public class Write {
          public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        
            MyObject myObject = new MyObject("Walt");

            System.out.print("Object to save: " + myObject.getName());

            FileOutputStream fs = new FileOutputStream(new File("object.obj"));
            ObjectOutputStream os = new ObjectOutputStream(fs);
            os.writeObject(myObject);
            os.close();
          }
        }
      </pre>
    </div>

    <p>
      The code for reading an object from a file looks very similar: 
    </p>

    <div class="code">
      <label>Java</label>
      <pre>
        import java.io.ObjectInputStream;
        import java.io.FileInputStream;
        import java.io.File;

        public class Read {
          public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
            FileInputStream fs = new FileInputStream(new File("object.obj"));
            ObjectInputStream os = new ObjectInputStream(fs);
            MyObject myObject = (MyObject)os.readObject();
            os.close();
            System.out.println("Object read from file: " + myObject.getName());
          }
        }
      </pre>
    </div>

    <p>
      Of course, in a real program, you will want to handle exceptions, instead
      of just declaring <code>throws Exception</code> on the main method. The
      best way to handle exceptions is to use a try-with-resources block, which
      will always close the resource being used (an
      <code>ObjectOutputStream</code> for example). This simplifies your code,
      and ensures no resources are leaked.
    </p>
    
    <h4>Conclusion</h4>
    <p>
      Serializing an object in Java allows us to store a representation of that
      object in a file, or send the object over a network. It allows for simple
      persistent storage of Java objects.
    </p>
    <p>
      Object serialization isn't meant to solve all data persistence problems.
      Issues will arise if multiple threads need to access the same file
      storing an object, and keeping track of many files can be difficult. In
      cases like these, a database would be a more appropriate solution. Also,
      reading serialized objects is easy in Java, but what if you need to
      send objects to a server that isn't written in Java? In this situation,
      storing the Java object in JSON, then sending the JSON data would make
      more sense. Many programming languages support JSON, so it is a great
      format to use when communicating with servers.
