    <h3>About Project</h3>
    <p>
      I started building this application as a part of a
      <a href="https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-nodejs-developer-course-2/">
      Udemy course</a> (which I would recommend to anyone who wants to learn
      node.js). The purpose of this project is to learn how to use node.js for
      realtime client-server communication using the socketio library.

    <h5>Features</h5>
    <p>
      When first visiting the website, a user can pick a name and a room to
      join. Then the user can send plain text messages to the other users in
      the room. Also, each user can send their location in the form of a link
      to their location on Google maps. Each user can see the list of other
      users in the chat room.
    </p>
    <h5>In progress</h5>
    <p>
      These are extra features that are still in development.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Password protected rooms</strong> - On the "join" page, users
        enter a password along with their name and room. If the room is empty,
        a new room is created with the given password, which can be blank.
        If the room is not empty, the entered password has to match the
        password that was given by the first person to join that room.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Send images and files</strong> - On the "chat" page, users can
        send images or files to the other members of the room.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>React or Angular frontend</strong> - Rewrite client side code
        to use a JavaScript framework such as React or Angular.
      </li>
    </ul>
