  <h2>About me</h2>
  <p>
    I graduated from Pacific Lutheran University in May 2017 with degrees in
    Computer Science and Mathematics. I'm a certified Pega System Architect
    with a background in full-stack Java development. In my free time, I like to learn new
    technologies and programming languages. Check out my
    <a href="projects.html">projects</a> page!
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm interested in programming, Java, computer security, cryptography
    and number theory.
  </p>

    At PLU, I was a math tutor. This opportunity gave me valuable experience
    in teaching and communication. Subjects I tutored included calculus,
    pre-calculus, linear algebra, abstract algebra, and business math.
