  <h2>About me</h2>
  <p>
    I'm currently working at a healthcare company as a QA analyst. At work, I
    enjoy finding new ways to automate various tasks. I have experience with
    designing and developing integrations for HP ALM, the software we use to
    manage requirements, test cases, and defects. I made improvements to an
    existing Java Swing GUI application used for daily web service regression
    testing. The improvements I made improved productivity. In my current role,
    I test ETL pipelines using SAS, UNIX utilities and other tools. My team
    validates systems built on relational databases and Hadoop (Hive, Impala,
    Sqoop, HDFS files).

    I graduated from Pacific Lutheran University in May 2017 with degrees in
    Computer Science and Mathematics. I'm an Oracle certified Java programmer
    with an interest in full-stack Java development. In my free time, I like to
    learn new technologies and programming languages. Check out my
    <a href="projects.html">projects</a> page!
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm interested in programming, Java, computer security, cryptography
    and number theory.

    At PLU, I was a math tutor. This opportunity gave me valuable experience
    in teaching and communication. Subjects I tutored included calculus,
    pre-calculus, linear algebra, abstract algebra, and business math.
