  <h2>About me</h2>
  <p>
    I graduated from Pacific Lutheran University in May 2017 with degrees in Computer Science and Mathematics. Currently, I'm looking for a career in Software Engineering/Software Development. In my free time, I like to learn new technologies and programming languages. Check out my <a href="projects.html">projects</a> page!

    I'm interested in programming, computer security, cryptography and number theory.
