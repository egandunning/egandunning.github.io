<h1>Bluetooth mouse app</h1>
  <h3>About project</h3>
  <p>
    This project has two parts: a bluetooth server that controls mouse and keyboard
    inputs, and an android app that sends mouse movement information and keystrokes
    to the bluetooth server.
  </p>
  <p>
    My purpose was to make a remote mouse and keyboard for the Raspberry Pi. I
    wanted to make the mouse user friendly and intuitive.
  </p>
  <h5>Server</h5>
  <p>
    The server is written in python for the bluez linux bluetooth stack. The server
    accepts incoming connections and recieves data from the client device. After
    the client closes the connection, the server is ready to accept another
    connection.
  </p>
  <p>
    Mouse and keyboard emulation is handled by xdotool, a linux command line
    program.
  </p>
  <h5>Client</h5>
  <p>
    The client is an android application that acts as a touchpad and keyboard.

      <figcaption>The android app. From here, users can disconnect from the server,
      shut down the server machine and control mouse/keyboard input.</figcaption>
    </figure>
  </p>
  
  <h5>Bluetooth message structure</h5>
  <p>
    The client sends messages to the server in the following format:
    <span class="oneline">[code character][data]</span>. The code character
    specifies what type of data is sent. For example, to send mouse movement
    data, the client sends the message <span class="oneline">"mx y"</span>
    where x and y are the pixel amounts to move the mouse cursor on the server
    machine. The message that moves the cursor 100 pixels down and 300 pixels to
    the right is "m300 -100".
  </p>
  
  <h5>Getting mouse data</h5>
  <p>
    To get mouse movement data in the android app, we can override the
    <code>onTouchEvent</code> action listener. This method is called whenever
    the user touches the phone screen. We want to record the distance the user
    drags their finger on the screen, so we will need two point variables. One
    point will represent the finger's starting postition, the second point will
    represent the finger's ending position.
  </p>
  <p>
    In order to make keeping track of points simple, we should make a Point
    class (code linked below). In our Point class, we need to be able to access
    and modify x and y coordinates, and do some basic vector arithmetic. For
    convenience, we'll want a method that returns a string representation of the
    point that is ready to send to the server.
  </p>
  
  <h5>Sending mouse data</h5>
  <p>
    To send the string messages from the android app, get the
    <code>OutputStream</code> from an open <code>BluetoothSocket</code>.
  </p>
  <div class="code">
    <label>Java</label>
    <pre>
      OutputStream os = serverSocket.getOutputStream();
      String message = "m300 -100";
    </pre>
  </div> 
  <p>
    In order to send the message to the server, we need to write the message to
    the output stream. First we need to convert the string to a byte array.
  </p>
  <div class="code">
    <label>Java</label>
    <pre>
      os.write(message.getBytes());
    </pre>
  </div>
  <p>
    Now the message has been sent to the server. The server has to recieve and
    interpret the message and act accordingly. This loop recieves messages from
    the connected client continuously:
  </p>
  <div class="code">
    <label>Python</label>
    <pre>
      while(True):
        data = client_sock.recv(64)
    </pre>
  </div>
  <p>
    Here, <code>client_sock</code> is the client socket. The <code>recv(64)
    </code> method waits until the client sends a message, then reads 64 bytes
    from that message. More than 64 bytes can be read if desired, but the
    client sends short messages, so in this case a message size limit of 64
    bytes should be plenty.
  </p>
  <p>
    After receiving a message, the server separates the code character from the
    data. Since the code character is always only on character, this separation
    is easy. All we need to do is store the first character in a variable, and
    then remove the first character from <code>data</code>.
  </p>
  <div class="code">
    <label>Python</label>
    <pre>
      code = data[0]
      data = data[1:]
    </pre>
  </div>
  <p>
    Now that the code character and the data are separate, we can handle
    different types of messages from the client.
  </p>
  <div class="code">
    <label>Python</label>
    <pre>
      if code == "m": #mouse movement
        os.system("xdotool mousemove_relative -- %s" % data)

      elif code == "1": #mouse1
        os.system("xdotool click 1")

      elif code == "2": #mouse2
        os.system("xdotool click 2")
      
      ...
    </pre>
  </div>
  <p>
    The data is sent directly to xdotool by using <code>os.system()</code>,
    which allows us to execute command line programs from our python code. The
    xdotool option we use to move the mouse is <code>mousemove_relative --
    </code>. <code class="oneline">xdotool mousemove_relative x y</code> tells
    xdotool to move the cursor <code>x</code> pixels to the right and
    <code>y</code> pixels up from the cursor's current position. The
    <code>--</code> allows negative coordinates, such as 
    <code class="oneline">xdotool mousemove_relative -- 0 -10</code>, which
    moves the cursor 10 pixels down.
  </p>
  <p>
    To emulate keystrokes, we use xdotool with the <code>key</code> option. For
    example, to send the letter "a", use the command <code class="oneline">
    xdotool key a</code>. Emulating letter keys is easy, but emulating special
    characters is harder. The command <code class="oneline">xdotool key ,</code>
    would fail and not emulate the "," key. The correct command to emulate a
    comma keypress is <code class="oneline">xdotool key comma</code>. This means
    we need to do some additional processing to convert character data to data
    that xdotool can understand.
  </p>
  
  <h5>Special characters</h5>
  <p>
    We need to convert special characters into strings of letters that xdotool
    can read. I chose to do this conversion on the client side. This way, the
    client can be modified to support more special characters while the server
    is still running.
  </p>
  <p>
    We can create a class to convert special characters to strings. In my
    implementation, I wrote a method that takes a <code>KeyEvent</code> as input
    and returns the correct xdotool character name.
  </p>
  <div class="code">
    <label>Java</label>
    <pre>
      public static String getXDoToolKey(KeyEvent event) {
        int keyCode = event.getKeyCode();

        switch(keyCode) {
          case KeyEvent.KEYCODE_DEL:
            return "BackSpace";

          case KeyEvent.KEYCODE_PERIOD:
            return "period";

          case KeyEvent.KEYCODE_SEMICOLON:
            return "semicolon";

          ...
      </pre>
  </div>
  <p>
    The <code>KeyEvent</code> class reports key events, and has static integer
    fields that represent keys. Writing this conversion method was tedious,
    since I could not find a list of all the possible xdotool key names, so I
    had to guess and check.
  </p>
  
  <h5>Sending keys</h5>
  <p>
    Sending keypresses over bluetooth is very similar to sending mouse movement
    data over bluetooth. In the main activity, override the <code>onKeyUp</code>
    listener.
  </p>
  <div class="code">
    <label>Java</label>
    <pre>
      @Override
      public boolean onKeyUp(int keyCode, KeyEvent event) {
        if(keyCode != KeyEvent.KEYCODE_BACK) {
          sendKey(KeyCodeTranslator.getXDoToolKey(event));
        }
        return super.onKeyUp(keyCode, event);
      }

      private void sendKey(String keys) {
        try {
          serverSocket.getOutputStream().write(("p"+keys).getBytes());
        } catch(IOException e) {
          e.printStackTrace();
        }
      }
    </pre>
  </div>
  <p>
    In the <code>onKeyUp</code> action listener, ignore the back button, since
    it isn't part of the keyboard. Then translate the <code>KeyEvent</code> into
    a string, then call <code>sendKey</code>, which writes the string to the
    socket's output stream. The character code "p" tells the server to emulate a
    key press.
  </p>
  
  <h5>Closing the connection</h5>
  <p>
    When the user is done using the application, the server should be able to
    close the connection, continue running, and accept another connection. In
    the server code, the main loop calls the function called 
    <code>connect_recv_loop() </code>that waits for a connection, then receives
    and processes data. When the server receives a disconnect message, the
    function <code>connect_recv_loop()</code> returns true. If the server
    receives a shutdown message, the function returns false.
  </p>
  
  <div class="code">
    <label>Python</label>
    <pre>
      while(connect_recv_loop()):
        print "connection closed"
      
      print "exiting"
      #end of file
    </pre>
  </div>
  
  <p>
    This allows the server to accept a new connection after the current
    connection closes. Inside <code>connect_recv_loop()</code>, if the code
    character sent from the client is "c", the server closes the open sockets
    and returns true.
  </p>
  
  <div class="code">
    <label>Python</label>
    <pre>
      ...
      elif code == "c": #close connection
	      close_resources()
	      return True
    </pre>
  </div>
  
  <p>
    If the client sends a message with the code character "s", <code>
    connect_recv_loop()</code> tells the computer to shut down in 1 second and
    returns false, causing main loop to exit, ending the program's execution.
    Note that the shutdown feature only works on a machine that is configured to
    not require a password for the "sudo shutdown" command. By default, the
    raspberry pi doesn't require a password with sudo commands, so the shutdown
    feature works just fine on a raspberry pi server.
  </p>
  
  <div class="code">
    <label>Python</label>
    <pre>
      elif code == "s": #shutdown
        os.system("sleep 1 && sudo shutdown -h now")
        close_resources()
        return False
    </pre>
  </div>
  
  <p>
    The app sends a disconnect message whenever the user presses the
    "disconnect" or back button and when the user exits the app. The shutdown
    message is sent when the user presses the "shutdown" button and confirms the
    dialog.

      <figcaption>The shutdown dialog.</figcaption>
    </figure>
  </p>
  
  <h5>Server details</h5>
  <p>
    The server runs on the Raspbian operating system on a Raspberry Pi. To make
    the server start when the Raspberry Pi starts up, add a desktop
    configuration file to <code>~/.config/autostart</code> - I called my desktop
    file bluemouse.desktop. Here are the contents of bluemouse.desktop:
  </p>
  <div class="code">
    <pre>
      [Desktop Entry]
      Type=Application
      Name=bluemouse autostart
      Comment=start bluemouse server
      Exec=/home/pi/Desktop/server.py
    </pre>
  </div>
  <p>
    This only works if both server.py and bluemouse.desktop have executable
    permissions, and if the <code>Exec</code> line contains the correct path to
    server.py.
  </p>
  
  <h5>Possible improvements</h5>
  <p>
    Currently the app connects to a hardcoded device name, "raspberrypi", which
    is fine if the user only wants to use the mouse for a raspberry pi with the
    default bluetooth name. A better system would be to ask the user which
    device to connect to upon opening the app.
  </p>
  <p>
    Not all special characters can be translated into strings that xdotool
    understands. This is because the method that converts <code>KeyCode</code>s
    to strings doesn't support all special characters. Adding more conversions
    would allow the user to send more types of symbols to the server.
  </p>
  <p>
    Better scrolling- currently the only scroll buttons are the up and down
    arrow keys. This makes scrolling very slow, a better solution would be to
    implement two-finger scrolling like on a laptop touchpad.
