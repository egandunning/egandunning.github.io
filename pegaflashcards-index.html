  <h3>About Project</h3>
  <p>
    This project is a command-line program that extracts key terms and their
    definitions from the Pega Academy Glossary. Since this glossary is
    proprietary, the user must create an account on the PDN (Pega Developer
    Network). The glossary can be found by enrolling in a course on the PDN.
    Start a lesson, then click the "Complete Glossary" link on the right side
    of the page. The program is written for the glossary from the System
    Architect Essentials course for Pega 7.2.
  </p>
  <p>
    I wrote this program in Java, the program parses the html file looking for
    <code>span</code> tags. The first <code>span</code> tag contains the key
    term, the second <code>span</code> tag contains the definition. Each key,
    definition pair is stored in an list which is serialized and written to
    a file for easy access.
  </p>
  <p>
    To review key terms, run the program with the <code>random</code> command
    line argument. Press enter to bring up a key term, enter again to show the
    definition, enter again to repeat.
  </p>
  <p>
    To lookup definitions for terms, run the program with the
    <code>lookup</code> command line argument. Enter a key term to look up
    a definition. The search term is case insensitive.
